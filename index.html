    <br>If you prefer a Facebook page, there is one <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/radiojumpstart">here</a> but it's not as active these days.  If you do not have a Facebook account, it will also ask you to sign up.
    <br>Both of these processes ask for some basic information that does NOT go the group admin.</br>
